/* fd_voter_state is a struct representation of the bincode-serialized
   layout of a voter's state (known in Agave parlance as "VoteState").
   This struct is then used to support zero-copy access of members.

   The voter's state is versioned, and the serialized formats differ
   depending on this.  Currently, the only version that differs from the
   others that is relevant here is v0.23.5.  Thus v0.23.5 has its own
   dedicated struct definition with a different set of fields that
   precede the votes than the other versions.  Furthermore, v0.23.5
   contains votes of type `fd_vote_lockout_t` vs. the other versions
   which are of type `fd_landed_vote_t`.  The only difference between
   `fd_vote_lockout_t` and `fd_landed_vote_t` is there is an additional
   uchar field `latency`, so that is we include an offset of 0 or 1
   depending on which vote state type it is.

   The layout begins with a set of fields providing important metadata
   about the voter.  Immediately following these fields is the tower
   itself. The tower layout begins with the number of votes currently in
   the tower ie. `cnt`.  Then the votes themselves follow. The format of
   the votes varies depending on the version.  Finally the layout
   concludes with the tower's root slot.

   --------
   metadata <- variable. depends on vote state version
   --------
   cnt      <- 8 bytes. bincode-serialized u64
   --------
   votes    <- variable. depends on vote state version and cnt
   --------
   root     <- 5 or 1 byte(s). bincode-serialized Option<u64>
   --------
