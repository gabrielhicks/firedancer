/* fd_ghost implements Solana's LMD-GHOST ("latest message-driven greedy
   heaviest-observed subtree") fork choice rule.

   Protocol details:

   - LMD is an acronym for "latest message-driven".  It describes how
     votes are counted when picking the best fork.  In this scheme, only
     a validator's latest vote counts.  So if a validator votes for slot 
     3 and then slot 5, the vote for 5 overwrites the vote for 3.

   - GHOST is an acronym for "greedy heaviest-observed subtree":

     greedy:   for each depth of the tree, pick the locally optimal
               child / subtree / fork.  This will result in the global
               optimal choice.

     heaviest: pick based on the highest stake weight.

     observed: this is the validator's local view, and other validators
               may have differing views because they've observed
               different votes.

     subtree:  pick based on the weight of an entire subtree, not just
               an individual node.  For example, if slot 3 has 10 stake
               and slot 5 has 5 stake, but slot 5 has two children 6
               and 7 that each have 3 stake, our weights are

               slot 3 subtree [3]        = 10
               slot 5 subtree [5, 6, 7]  = 11 (5+3+3)

               Therefore slot 5 would be the heaviest.

   In-memory representation:

   - Each tree node is keyed by slot number.

   - Each tree node tracks the amount of stake (`stake`) that has voted
     for its slot, as well as the recursive sum of stake for the subtree
     rooted at that node (`weight`).

   This is simply a reference for those curious about the etymology, and
   not prerequisite reading for understanding this implementation. */
